/**
 * Optional annotation, applicable to both Classes and Methods.<br>
 * <br>
 * Indicates the path under which commands should be added.
 * The path should be delimited with the delimiter '/'.<br>
 * The initial delimiter is unnecessary, as paths always start from the root.<br>
 * <br>
 * When a class is annotated, the path is referred to as the 'top level path'.
 * All the class's methods annotated with {@link Command} will inherit its 'top level path'.
 * <br>
 * Annotated inner classes can also specify their own path, in which case it will be appended
 * to the class's 'top level path'.
 * If An inner class does not specify a path through this annotation, the 'top level path' for all it's commands
 * will be the 'top level path' of it's outer class.
 * Only inner classes with the default constructor (no args) will be processed, others will be ignored.
 * <br>
 * Each method annotated with {@link Command} can also specify it's own path, in which case it will be appended
 * to the class's 'top level path'.
 * <br>
 * Classes not annotated will be considered as though they are under root and methods not annotated
 * will inherit the class's 'top level path'.
